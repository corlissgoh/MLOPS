      "The story starts with Haruhiko explaining about human sense of vision, as well as optical illusions and visual preconceptions. The students of Hosea Academy goes for a summer trip by the sea. During the trip, Haruhiko states that he hates summer, and wishes that he is inside his house reading... until the other boys point out about the swimsuits the girls would be wearing. When they arrived, they are told that even though there are a lot of visitors each year, a sudden appearance of a Phantom scares people away, so they are asked to exterminate the said Phantom. In return, the lodging and food fees will be free. That being said, when asked about what the Phantom did, the lodge house owner refused to say anything. The first day pass by without anything happened, and they thought that since there is no visitors, probably the Phantom had moved to somewhere else. Unable to sleep, Haruhiko and Mai have a small talk under the moonlight, and Ruru disturbs them when the mood is just good. Before they know it, Koito, Kurumi and Reina join the gathering as well. During the next day, they play by the sea. Attracted by the girls in swimsuits, the Phantom appears and shoots water beam towards them, making a polka dot censor to make an optical illusion of them naked. Despite trying their best while being embarrassed, their attacks have no effect at all. Haruhiko summons Marchosias and Chtulu and is able to repel the censor effect for a moment, but being angry, the Phantom enlarges itself and shoots a huge amount of water to the air, this time creating white censor bar, with the same effect as the previous censor. Two of Haruhiko's male friends already give in to temptation of seeing the naked illusion, but Shousuke reminds them that it's more erotic if \"you thought you can see it, but you can't\" (though they are defeated in the end anyway). Figuring out the basis of the Phantom's ability of manipulating light and temperature, Haruhiko asks Koito to surrounds the Phantom with her fire voice to disperse the effect. With the illusion ended, Mai uses the sea to increase her water techniques, while Kurumi uses Albrecht to throw the Phantom in the air, which ends up eaten by Reina. With the case finally resolved, they feel that they can enjoy the rest of the vacation, until Haruhiko come back from the sea (he was swept away by the current when Mai and Albrecht attack the Phantom) without his swimming trunks, now really naked instead of just an illusion. As the four main heroines run away out of embarrassment, an equally embarrassed Haruhiko shouts that he hates summer (though Ruru likes it).\n",

The expedition was led by Lisa Hayes aboard the SDF-3, which was launched in 2022 in search of the Robotech Masters.

      "Souten Kouro's story is based loosely on the events taking place in Three Kingdoms period of China during the life of the last Chancellor of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Cao Cao (155 – March 15, 220), who also serves as the main character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades, but Souten Kouro differs greatly from most of the others on several points. One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\r\n",

The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world`s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (`Bishounen-Killer`) Bancoran. Bancoran`s nickname doesn`t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran`s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour`s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran`s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang`s Metropolis, while Jack`s `apartment` bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst`s spread.)

      "This version of Pinocchio tells a story of an extremely gullible, naive and morally confused wooden doll brought to life by a mystical blue fairy. Pinocchio (Mokku) is characterized as having many character faults which he must learn to overcome in order to be worthy of being granted humanity. Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Throughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.\r\n",
